     GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
(independent of having been made by running the Program).

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice; and that you post a copy of this License along with
the Program. You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring
a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange
for a fee.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above,
provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

  a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

  b) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge
to all third parties under the terms of this License.

  c) If a facility in the modified Program refers to a function or
data to a covered work, you must ensure that, if the modified Program
is used in a network server, the source code of the modified version is
made available to the users of that server, using the same method that
you provide access to the users of the unmodified Program.

3. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.

4. You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License. You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.

5. This License is intended to make sure that you have the freedom to
distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you
wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that
you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs;
and that you know you can do these things.

6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensors to copy, distribute, or modify the Program subject
to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.

7. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
detail to address new problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

8. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

9. There is no warranty for the Program, and the copyright holders and/or
other parties provide the Program "as is" without any express or implied
warranty. You bear the risk of the quality and performance of the Program.
If the Program is defective, you alone must fix it. 

10. In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing
will any copyright holder, or any other party who modifies and/or
distributes the Program, be liable to you for damages, including any
general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of
the use or inability to use the Program (including but not limited to
loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you
or third parties or a failure of the Program to operate with any other
programs), even if such holder or other party has been advised of the
possibility of such damages.

11. If you have not received a copy of this License, along with the Program,
you should write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street,
Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA, or visit their web page,
http://www.gnu.org/.
